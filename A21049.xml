            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is not any one thing that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan the profeſſed enemie of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind labours, and endeauours more, then the hindrance of the ſaluation of man. There is but one way to Heauen, that which <hi>Peter</hi> cals the <hi>way of Truth,</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. which <hi>Salomon</hi> cals <hi>the way of good men, Prou.</hi> 2. 20. which <hi>Iſaie</hi> cals <hi>the way of Holineſſe, Iſai.</hi> 35. 8. which <hi>Ieremie</hi> cals <hi>the old, and the good way,</hi> and <hi>the ancient pathes, Ier.</hi> 6. 16, 18, 15. Now Sathan to
<pb facs="tcp:259:5"/> keepe men from Heauen, doth his vtmoſt to make men ſtumble at, and <hi>from the ancient pathes,</hi> that by taking offence at the waies of God, diſliking, and diſtaſting them, the ſaluation of their ſoules might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come impoſſible.</p>
            <p>To effect their ſtumbling at thoſe wayes Sathan layes many and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie kinds of ſtumbling blockes in the wayes of men. But yet amongſt thoſe many ones, I find there bee ſome more dangerous then others, and by which the Deuill preuayles much more then by the reſt. And thoſe I obſerue and conceiue to be ſpecially theſe three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Reproach, Contempt, and Obloquie, that by ſome men is vſually caſt vpon Religion and the conſcionable profeſſion, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours thereof. Sathan tels men that if they will needs goe this way they ſhall haue a deale of filth and dirt flung in the faces of them, that
<pb facs="tcp:259:6"/> they muſt looke to be ſcorned, and Reproached, as if they were the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Of-ſcourings of the earth.</hi> And this very thing ſtarts and ſtumbles not a few. Some will better abide a ſtake, then ſome others can a mocke. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> could happily haue found in his heart to haue hearkened to the Prophets coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, but that this lay in the way, <hi>I am afraid of the Iewes, leaſt they deliuer me into the Caldaeans hands, and they mocke me, Ier.</hi> 38. 19. It was death to him to be mocked. But all conſidered, we ſhall ſee how little reaſon any haue for this to ſtumble at Religion. For doe but conſider who they are commonly that mock at Godlineſſe. Doe but obſerue their Character in the Scriptures, and you ſhall finde them ſuch as theſe. A company of Hypocrites. <hi>Hypocriticall mockers, Pſal.</hi> 35. 16. A crue of Drunkards, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 12. <hi>I am the ſong of Drunkards.</hi> A ſort

A company of <hi>Abiect perſons, Pſal.</hi> 35. 15. Like thoſe enemies, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 5. <hi>Lewd fellowes of the baſer ſort.</hi> A rout of prophane godleſſe irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Atheiſts that do no more know the Power, then Turkes, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens know the truth, of Godlines, <hi>The foole hath ſaid in his heart there is no God, you haue made</hi> a mocke <hi>at the counſell of the poore, becauſe the Lord is his truſt, Pſ.</hi> 14. 1, 6. It is a ſhrewd ſuſpition, that he that is a Mocker is an Atheiſt, It well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes him to mocke at Religion that denies a God, and it is a ſigne that he denies a God, that mockes at Godlineſſe. And will any wiſe man ſtumble at Religion for ſuch mens Mockes and Reproaches? What can be expected better from them?

               <hi>qui, ita vt tu, vixit aliter, quam tu loqui poteſt,</hi> It cannot be but that he that liues thy life, ſhould ſpeake thy language, and it is an anſwere will ſerue the turne in this caſe; To looke for other language from men of ſo ill lifes, were to expect to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grapes of thornes.

Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if men had but an eye of faith
<pb facs="tcp:259:9"/> in their heads. Carnal eyes that are dazeled with the glittering out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides of worldly glories are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at ſuch ſeeming baſeneſſe, but faith blindes it ſelfe againſt ſuch fleſhly Scandals, and will not ſee them, when it ſees them, but lookes thorough them, and ſees glory thorough them. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>And the word was made fleſh, and wee beheld his glory, as the glory of the onely begotten ſonne of the father,</hi> though his glory were obſcured with the vaile of the fleſh, yet this vaile hides not glory from the eye of faith, faith did looke thorough this vaile and eaſily diſcerned him the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and only begotten ſonne of the father, euen in the abaſement of his Incarnation. The wiſemen that came from the Eaſt, when they ſaw <hi>Herod</hi> at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> happily in all his royall Robes, yet fall not downe not worſhip him; They come to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> and finde Chriſt in a
<pb facs="tcp:259:9"/> poore faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, happily in little better then rags, &amp; yet they fall downe &amp; worſhip him. Why fall they downe before a meane poore Chriſt, and not before a Magnificent, &amp; glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Herod?</hi> Why rather are they not ſcandalized at Chriſts baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and pouerty? This is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of faith, In Chriſts Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it ſaw Antiquity, in his baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe beauty, in his meanneſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, and more glory in Chriſts rags, then in <hi>Herods</hi> Robes. So ſurely if men did liue and walke by faith, and not by ſight, neuer would Chriſt nor his Truth be ſtumbled at for the homely and poore out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of thoſe that profeſſe him. The purblind eye of fleſh cannot pierce through theſe vayles and cloudes, And what wonder is it to ſee a blinde man ſtumble?</p>
            <p n="3">3. But yet the ſoreſt and greateſt ſtumbling blocke of all, is the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſinnes and falles of ſuch as
<pb facs="tcp:259:10"/> profeſſe religion: certaine it is that theſe of all others are the moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous ſtumbling blockes by which Satan cauſes multitudes of men to ſtumble at religion, and workes them to the diſlike of the wayes of ſaluation. Afflictions and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions for the Goſpells ſake are dangerous ſtumbling blockes, and by reaſon of them many are ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at religion, as that they turne their backes vpon it, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 21. <hi>When tribulation, or perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſes becauſe of the word by and by, he is ſcandalized.</hi> So that Perſecutions cauſe Scandal. But yet the Scandals that come by the euill lifes of profeſſours are in ſome ſenſe farre more dangerous and hurtfull then thoſe Scandals that come from Perſecutions. Though the ſcandal of perſecution ſtumble &amp; beate off many, yet haue very many beene gayned to a loue, and liking of Religion, by the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb facs="tcp:259:10"/> Courage, &amp; Conſtancy of the Saints of God in Perſecution. But neuer were, nor wilbe any gayned thereunto by the ſcandalous falles of profeſſours. Perſecutions keepe men off by feare, but Scandalous ſinnes by Hardening mens hearts. There is far more hope, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of gayning a man that is kept off by feare, then of ſuch as are kept off by a ſetled, reſolued Hardnes of Heart. In ſcandals of the Croſſe men may haue ſome ſecret likings of the Truth, may haue ſecret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes in better times to owne it, but in ſcandals of euill example, men grow to an open, and profeſſed diſlike thereof. In ſcandals of the croſſe, there is not alwayes a diſlike of Religion it ſelfe, but onely of the hard termes, with which it muſt bee receiued, but from ſcandals of euill life growes a diſlike of Religion it ſelfe. Notwithſtanding the ſcandal of the croſſe men may haue an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable,
<pb facs="tcp:259:11"/> and a good conceit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but ſcandals of euill life breede, and nouriſh a baſe and a vile eſteeme thereof in the hearts of men. So that perſecutions doe not doe that miſchiefe that ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous falles doe. <hi>Malicious perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours</hi> in ſome ſenſe doe not that hurt that <hi>ſcandalous profeſſours doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſcandalous euents being ſo miſchieous and pernitious, and yet withall ſo common, &amp; ſo frequent, why may it not be a worke of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to counterworke Satan, and to remoue out of the way theſe dangerous ſtumbling blockes, at which ſo many fall to their vtter ruine, and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>As Satan <hi>Balaam-</hi>like <hi>eaſts</hi> ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks in, ſo ſhould it be our care to <hi>take</hi> vp theſe ſtumbling blockes out of mens wayes. It is not enough for vs that wee <hi>put not a ſtumbling blocke,</hi> or an occaſion to fall in another mans way, as the
<pb facs="tcp:259:11"/> Apoſtle aduiſes <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 12. But when others haue done it, our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour ſhould be, to take ſuch a ſtumbling blocke out of the way. It is Gods owne commandement we ſhould ſo doe, <hi>Iſay</hi> 57. 14. <hi>Take vp the ſtumbling blocke out of the way of my people.</hi> It were happy if wee could preuent ſcandals, but ſince that cannot bee <hi>(for it muſt needs be that offences come)</hi> the next happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is to preuent their miſchiefe, that though they doe come, yet they may come with as little hurt as may be. <note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>To make way for what followes it is fit to conſider what is heere meant by <hi>Scandal</hi> or <hi>Offence.</hi> That we call a ſcandal, which is or may be in it ſelfe an occaſion of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vnto another. Any thing whereby wee ſo offend another, as that hee is hindred from Good, drawne into, or confirmed in euill, is a ſcandal. Now a ſcandal may be. 1. Firſt, in doctrine, and this is ſcandal giuen in hereſies, falſe doctrines. Secondly, by the abuſe or the vnſeaſonable vſe of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an libertie, of which kinde of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:259:17"/> the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 10. Thirdly, Scandal may be giuen by mens lifes, when their lifes and actions are ſuch as croſſe, and thwart the Religion profeſſed by vs, and diſhonours the Name of God, which we haue taken vp. As when a man profeſſes the Name &amp; Faith of Chriſt, and profeſſes it zealouſly, and yet fals into vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, drunkenneſſe, into groſſe and notorious acts of fraude and coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenage, theſe bee ſcandals and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences becauſe they be occaſions to make others fall, they hinder ſome from comming towards goodneſſe and Religion, and they harden and confirme ſome in their ſinfull and euill courſes. Thus <hi>Dauids</hi> murther and adultery, <hi>Noahs</hi> drunkenneſſe, the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthians</hi> marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age were ſcandalous actions. Now though this text reach to offences of all kinds, yet I will onely med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with offences of this laſt kinde,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:259:18"/> ſuch as bee the groſſe and foule courſes and practices of any ſuch as haue taken vpon them the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpell, and the Name of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>The Neceſsitie of ſcandalous euents in Gods Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He point we haue then firſt to handle is this. <hi>That there is a neceſsitie of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous euents in the Church of God. That ſcandalous euents, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhall aſſuredly and infallibly fall out amongſt thoſe that profeſſe the Name of Chriſt.</hi> It muſt bee, and it muſt needs bee that offences come. So, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 1. <hi>It is impoſsible but that offences ſhould come.</hi> And as the Apoſtle ſpeakes of hereſies, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:259:19"/> of offences giuen in that kinde, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 19. <hi>There muſt be hereſies,</hi> ſo is it true of theſe kinds of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are giuen by ſinfull and foule actions, that there muſt bee ſcandals.</p>
               <p>This Neceſſitie ariſes from a threefold ground:</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the decree and councell of God, and his ſecret, but moſt Iuſt Iudgement: for God that brought light out of darkneſſe, can bring good out of euill, and can worke out his glory euen from thoſe things which in their euents ſeeme to make exceedingly to the impeaching and obſcuring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. God can gather grapes of theſe thiſtles, and figs of theſe thornes, and therefore his pleaſure it is, and ſo will he haue it that ſuch thornes, and thiſtles ſhould grow, and come vp in his garden. His wayes are not as our wayes, nor his thoughts as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:259:19"/> our thoughts. Hee can make that which for the preſent, and in our eye and apprehenſion is for the great diſhonour and diſgrace of his Name and Truth, to turn at the laſt to the greater honour, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of both. Hee by his permiſſiue decree orders all ſuch ſcandalous euents to worke together to bring him in a great, and a rich returne of glory. Therefore, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 20. God is ſaid to lay a ſtumbling blocke before a man, <hi>And I lay a ſtumbling blocke before him.</hi> God hath decreed that there ſhall bee ſcandals. Not a Sparrow falls on the ground without our Father, <hi>Math.</hi> 10. 29. And therefore not a Profeſſour of his Name falls into ſcandal without him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hauing decreed that ſcandals ſhall be, there is a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the euent, It is impoſſible but that there ſhould be offences. But
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:259:20"/> yet this decree doth in no wiſe make God the authour of theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, becauſe his decree hath no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitating influence into the wils of men. It is a neceſſitie of infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, and certaintie of the euent, but not a conſtraining, forcing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie to make them to doe that which ſhall giue ſcandal. Scandals ſhall neceſſarily, that is infallibly come to paſſe, but yet ſuch as giue ſcandal, ſhall not bee forced and neceſſarily conſtrained by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God to doe that they doe. They ſhall worke freely and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily in that which they doe, or elſe it were iniuſtice in God to bring a woe vpon him by whom an offence comes, if hee by a Superiour power from Heauen were forced and conſtrained to fall into ſcandal. What Gods holy ends are in that his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, wee ſhall ſee after in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:259:20"/> opening of the next point.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the malice of Sathan. The malice of the Deuill againſt Gods Truth, and Mans Saluation is exceeding great, and out of his malice againſt both, he endeuours nothing more then to make men ſinne. He goes about like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whome hee may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure. But yet though all bee fiſh that comes to his net, yet his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall malice is againſt thoſe of Gods Church, and thoſe therein that moſt zealouſly profeſſe his Name and Truth. He knowes that if he can but draw ſuch into his nets and ſnares, and make them fall into fowle and ſcandalous actions, this will in a great meaſure diſhonour God and his Goſpell, diſgrace Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Godlineſſe, and ſtartle ſuch as are but looking towardes God, and wonderfully harden ſuch in their ſinfull wayes that are not ſo forward in the zealous profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:259:21"/> of the Goſpell, and therefore of all others hee hath ſuch in his eye, and vſes all his power and policie toe nſnare and ſupplant ſuch more then a thouſand others. He had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther catch one fiſh then a thouſand frogs, rather fell one Cedar then a whole wood of ſhrubs. Satan ſees that the ſins and ſcandalous offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſuch will bee exceeding ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantageous to the aduancement of his kingdome, and will conduce to the ſtrengthening of his partie more then the falls of any other. Therefore hee ſets vpon them with all his might and malice aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Thou art, ſay they of <hi>Dauid, worth ten thouſand of vs,</hi> And if the enemy had ſurprized <hi>Dauid,</hi> it had beene more aduantage to him then to haue ſurprized ten thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> So Sathan reckons one zealous Profeſſour of Religion if he can but entrap him worth ten thouſand others for his turne. Such
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:259:21"/> a mans fal would more blemiſh the Goſpell, and make men more ſtumble at Godlineſſe then if ten thouſand others ſhould do the like. Therefore liues hee by the King of <hi>Syria</hi> his principle, <hi>Fight neither againſt ſmall nor great, ſaue onely againſt the King of Iſrael,</hi> for let the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> fall, and ſmall and great fall with him. His policie therefore is to aime and leuell eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at ſuch in whoſe fals hee may ruine many, and by whoſe ruines he may rayſe his owne kingdome. Other mens ſinnes worke nothing ſo much for his aduantage. <note n="a" place="margin">

It is no new thing, they doe but their kinde. The wonder were, if they ſhould bee, or doe otherwiſe. But when a man that profeſſes Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:259:22"/> and Religion ſhall fall into any of theſe fowle courſes, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely are thouſands ſtaggered and ſcandalized at it? How fowly is Religion and Godlineſſe blurred? How many are there who reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determine neuer to meddle with ſuch Religion? And ſo the Deuill hath his end, hath what hee would haue.</p>
               <p>Conſider to this end that exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>There is fornication amongſt you, and ſuch fornication as is not once named amongſt the Gentiles.</hi> Obſerue the horrible ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Satan againſt the Church of God, and ſuch as are within it, bee they ſound, or hypocriticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of the Goſpell. He labours to bring of them into fowler, and more notorious offenſiue euils, then the very heathens themſelues are guiltie of according to that, <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> 18. 13. <hi>Aske now amongſt the heathen who hath heard ſuch things.</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:259:22"/> 
                  <hi>The Virgin of Iſrael hath done an horrible thing.</hi> At that time Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were called out from amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the heathen, with whom they liued mingled together. Now the Deuill did what in him lay to keepe thoſe heathen from receiuing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, and Chriſtian Religion, that by no meanes they might hearken to it. Now to bring this about what was Satans proiect? He layes about him to enſnare ſome one of the Chriſtian <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and to bring him into fowler fornication then was amongſt the heathen. This the Deuill effects, and what thinke wee followed vpon it? Now haue the heathen occaſion to crie downe Chriſtian Religion, and to ſay, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold theſe be your Chriſtians that talke ſo much of holineſſe, where did they euer ſee any of vs whom they terme heathens to commit ſo fowle an act of Inceſt as to marrie his fathers wife. What are our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:259:23"/> and fornications they ſo much iudge vs for to ſuch fowle vncleanneſſe as this? This is your Chriſtian Religion, and theſe bee your Saints forſooth, now God bleſſe vs from ſuch a Religion, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer will wee be of ſuch a Religion. How much better is it to be honeſt heathens, nay, Adulterous forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Pagans then Inceſtuous Chriſtians? And thus queſtionles was many a Pagan mouth opened, and many an heathen heart ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, yea, many an one that before might be in ſome doubt of the euil condition of paganiſme was by this ſcandal kept off from looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſtian Religion. They li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not this Goſpell, and new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of theſe Chriſtians. Such mens ſcandals therefore being of ſo great aduantage for Satans pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and hee being ſo ſedulous and induſtrious to ſeeke and take all aduantages for his owne turne,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:259:23"/> hence it is that it cannot bee but that offences come.</p>
               <p>How wel did Satan foreſee what he ſhould gaine by <hi>Dauids</hi> Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal? Could hee but get <hi>Dauid</hi> in, and bring him to commit Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> it would ſtrike a greater ſtroke on his ſide, and do him more ſeruice then if a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuch as <hi>Doeg, Shimei,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophel</hi> ſhould doe the like. How many men would thereby be ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Dauids</hi> zealous profeſſion? How many hearts bee thereby har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened in their euill wayes? How many mens wayes be blockt vp for going to Heauen? How therefore in this caſe would, and did the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill put on to get <hi>Dauid</hi> downe, and to cauſe him to fall ſo fowly? The practiſes of the <hi>Carpocraſians,</hi> and the <hi>Gnoſtickes</hi> were ſtupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and prodigiouſly filthy and impure.

               <p>The Apoſtle ſpeakes of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, that it was a ſhame to ſpeake of thoſe things which they did in ſecret, but ſurely the moſt degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heathen that had put off na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, could not but think it a ſhame to ſpeake of thoſe things in ſecret which they did openly and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly, who tooke vpon them the name and profeſſion of Chriſtians.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:259:25"/> and preached Chriſt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes all, and followes him, and was as forward as the beſt of them. But becauſe all this was in hypocriſie, therefore his corruption held in for a time vnder this violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint at the laſt breakes fowly out, and becauſe hee fowly takes Gods Name in vaine, he is by diuine Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice left to himſelfe, and falls into that fearefull ſcandal of betraying Chriſt.

The houſe built vpon the ſand fell, and the <hi>fall of it was great:</hi> When Hypocrites fall, they fall not the ordinary fals of other men, <hi>Great was the fall of it,</hi> They fall into great and hainous ſcandals.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:259:26"/> ſcandall.

It is ſo with Hypocrites, they ſo fall, as if a man fel into and wallowed in the myre, ſo fowle and ſcandalous are their fals. Now, then, inaſmuch as it cannot be auoyded, and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, but that there will and ſhall be Hypocrites in the Church of God, and <hi>Satan will be ſtanding amongſt the children of God, Iob</hi> 1. and in as much as it cannot be but that rotten hypocriſie will breake out, and in regard of Gods Iuſtice muſt ſometimes bee diſcouered in this life, therefore there muſt needs

               <p n="2">2. Such as profeſſe ſincerely, and in Truth. Now euen in theſe there are yet great remaynders of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, the very beſt beare a bodie of ſin and death about them. And becauſe they are not ſo watchfull as they ſhould, to looke ſo narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their owne hearts as they ought, therefore comes it to paſſe alſo that offences muſt needs come. The heart of man is deceitfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. therefore ſhould Chriſtians bee watchfull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it aboue all things. But becauſe they truſt their falſe and looſe hearts to much, and grow remiſſe in their watch, thence comes it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to paſſe that offences muſt needs come. When they keepe not their own Vineyard, their mothers children are angrie with them, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 6. that is their naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions <note place="margin">Sic Iunius.</note>

It is not alwayes ſafe to iudge a man to bee an Hypocrite, becauſe hee giues ſcandal. Gods deareſt ſeruants are not alwaies freed and ſecured from falling into ſcandalous ſins. Well, but what made <hi>Dauid</hi> fall? All the while <hi>Dauid</hi> was in his exile, and affliction all that while <hi>Dauid</hi> was free enough. Afflictions kept him awake. But afterwards when <hi>Dauid</hi> came to be King, and liued in a full eſtate at his eaſe, then began he to be more remiſſe, and therfore after his afternoones nap when hee was walking vpon the roofe, the Deuill ſets a ſnare, and his owne remiſſe heart ſoone catches at the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:259:27"/> baite, and he is preſently enſnared. We find, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 27, 28. tares in the field amongſt the wheate. <hi>Sir, didſt thou not ſow good wheate in thy field? Whence then hath it tares? He ſaid vnto them, An enemie hath done this!</hi> Theſe tares are <hi>Scandals, Verſe</hi> 40, 41. <hi>They ſhall gather out of his kingdome all ſcandals.</hi> Wee ſee whence theſe ſcandals come, <hi>Verſe</hi> 28. <hi>An enemie hath done this.</hi> Satan hath a great hand in ſowing theſe tares.

They began to call the Law, and their Religion into queſtion, and like enough were ready to ſay, Surely this Law is not of God, nor this Religion which the Prieſts preach and profeſſe, is not from Heauen. For if this Law and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were from God, why liue theſe Prieſts ſo lewdly, and baſely. Thus the ſtumbled people reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

Is the Proteſtant Religion falſe, becauſe, as the Papiſts reaſon, ſo many Proteſtants are ſcandalous Drunkards, Adulterers, &amp;c. yea, let this reaſon ſtand good, &amp; ſhew mee that Religion in the whole World that can bee true; by this reaſon there is no true Religion at all on earth. For giue me any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion on the face of the earth, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh, Iewiſh, Heatheniſh, Popiſh or Proteſtant, among the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours whereof there may not ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous

               <p>I confeſſe, there is a caſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a religion may bee cried downe from the wicked, and looſe lifes of the Profeſſours thereof, and that is when the principles and doctrines of it are ſuch as open a gap, and giue libertie to looſe and diſhoneſt practices. When men doe not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breake the Commandements of God, but according to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their religion <hi>teach men to doe ſo, Math.</hi> 5. 19. As for example, when the Phariſies Diſciples did ſweare, did ſeeke reuenge, did hate their enemies, did neglect their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in their neceſſities, here a man might haue ſaid to them, <hi>This is your Religion,</hi> becauſe the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:259:35"/> of Phariſaiſme taught men ſo. When I ſee a Papiſt prophane the Sabbath in hawking, hunting, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, carding, dicing, dancing, and going to playes, here I may fall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his religion, becauſe the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of their religion is, <hi>that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided a man heare a Maſſe on the Sabbath be may ſpend the reſt of the day in thoſe things.</hi> When I ſee a Papiſt giue himſelfe to all lewdnes, and vitious vncleanneſſe, I may lay the blame vpon his religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the principles thereof ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a gap thereto. For what need I care for drunkenneſſe whileſt it is made but a <hi>Veniall ſin,</hi> and a Venial ſinne is ſuch, as our <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> ſay, is <hi>pardonable of it own nature,</hi> ſo ſlight <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rhem. in Rom.</hi> 1 32.</note> as a man need not make confeſſion of it, ſuch as makes no breach of friendſhip betweene God, and vs, ſo ſmall a triffle as may bee pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a knocke on the breaſt, by the Biſhops Bleſſing, by the ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

There is no religion wherein a man can ſinne ſo good cheape. Now therefore if wee ſee thoſe of that religion take libertie to looſe and ſinfull courſes, it is no iniuſtice to lay the blame, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation vpon their religion, whoſe Principles and Doctrines are ſuch as giue men libertie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
               <p>So if I ſhould ſee a man of the <hi>Pelagian</hi> faith and profeſſion to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:259:36"/> liue licentiouſly, in the neglect of the meanes of grace, and to denie himſelfe no carnal libertie, I would here condemne his religion from his life, becauſe the Grounds and Principles of his faith are ſuch as giue men libertie to liue as they liſt. For if ſo be there be a power of Free will in me, that I may repent and belieue if I will, and when I will, what need I then care what courſes I take, what ſinnes I runne into, ſo long as I can be ſaued when I liſt, I will trie ſuch and ſuch ſins, and when I haue taken my fill, at my pleaſure I will repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue. So that in ſuch a caſe it is not amiſſe to crie downe a Religion from the ſcandalous courſes of the Profeſſours thereof, and in ſuch a caſe a man may innocently ſay, <hi>This is your Religion.</hi> But on the contrarie, when a Religion is <hi>pure Religion,</hi> Iam. 1. 27. <hi>A Truth which is according to godlineſſe, Tit.</hi> 1. 1.

It is in this caſe betweene men of the world and ſcandals, as it was in <hi>Ahabs</hi> caſe betweene him and his falſe prophets, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 22. 20, 21, 22. God had a purpoſe out of diuine Iuſtice and vengeance that <hi>Ahab</hi> ſhould <hi>fall,</hi> and bee ruined. Now God enters into counſell what courſe ſhall bee taken to bring it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that hee may fall and periſh, <hi>Verſe</hi> 20. <hi>Who ſhall perſwade</hi> Ahab <hi>that hee may goe vp</hi> and fall <hi>at Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth Gilead.</hi> There comes forth a

God beſtowes his Word, and the Miniſterie of it vpon a people, it workes them not to Faith &amp; Repentance. Hereupon is the Lord prouoked to anger, and vpon that hee enters into a conſult of reuenge. Here be a company of men that haue had the meanes of grace, but they will not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, and raiſed vp, I am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolued they ſhall fall into Hell for euer. But who will now take ſome courſe that they may fal. Then ſteps forth Satan, I will take a courſe to make them fall fatally. And the Lord ſayes what courſe wilt thou take? Satan anſwers. I
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:259:55"/> will goe forth and draw ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Profeſſour of Religion into ſome groſſe and ſcandalous ſinne. And that ſcandal of his wil be ſuch a ſtumbling blocke at which they will ſo ſtumble, that I will warrant them fall farre enough, and deepe enough for euer recouering out of the pit. And the Lord anſweres, Thou ſhalt effect it and preuaile, Goe forth and doe ſo. Goe Satan, preuaile with ſuch, and ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour of Religion to bring him into ſome fowle ſcandal. And let that ſcandal bee a fatal ſtumbling blocke to make ſuch fall, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly periſh, that would not bee wrought vpon by the word.</p>
               <p>So that looke what the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were to <hi>Ahab,</hi> that are ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals to the world, meanes of their fatall fals and ruines, woe to <hi>Ahab</hi> becauſe of the falſe prophets, and woe to the world becauſe of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals that make way for their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:259:55"/> as the falſe prophets did for <hi>Ahabs.</hi> So that by all this wee ſee that Gods diſpoſall of ſcandals, is an Act of diuine vengeance, and Iuſtice plaguing mens vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe vnder the meanes of grace, that by this means their righteous damnation might be ſealed vp, and made ſure.</p>
               <p>And therefore this is a point well worth our obſeruation. That where God ſends moſt preaching, and the greateſt meanes of grace, there commonly fall out the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and fouleſt ſcandals, and where litle or no meanes little or no ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal.</p>
               <p>Now what may the reaſon of this be? Not that the preaching of the Goſpel makes men worſe, as men of euil ſpirits are readie to ſlander and calumniate it in caſe of ſuch euents, but amongſt many other reaſons that might be giuen of it, this is one ſpeciall one. Where
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:259:56"/> God giues greateſt means of grace, and ſaluation, there mens ſinne in their vnprofitableneſſe, impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and vnbeliefe is the greater. The greater mens ſinnes are, the greater is Gods wrath, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of the greatneſſe of his wrath againſt mens great vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableneſſe, God diſpoſes it, that where the greateſt meanes of grace are neglected and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, there ſhall bee the greateſt ſcandals, that ſo hee may greatly plague great vnprofitableneſſe and contempt. God will haue ſuch as be vnprofitable vnder great means, to haue great fals, that they of all others may fall moſt lethally, and moſt dangerouſly, and fatally. Now a little ſtumbling ſtone cauſes but a little &amp; an eaſie fal, but the greater the ſtumbling block is, the greater, and more wofull muſt the fal needs bee. And therefore where greateſt meanes not profited by, are, there
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:259:56"/> are greateſt ſcandals to bring the greater woe, and vengeance vpon ſo great vnprofitableneſſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there the greateſt ſtumbling blockes to fall by, where the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt meanes to riſe by, that ſuch may not ſimply fall, but ſo fall that they may be daſht to peeces.</p>

               <p n="1">1. In that they make way for their ſtumbling at Religion and godlineſſe, the powerfull and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing profeſſion thereof. When men ſtumble at Religion and are ſo offended at Godlineſſe as to diſlike
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:259:57"/> and reiect it, and that with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorie reſolution of ſpirit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to receiue and embrace it, it muſt needs bee confeſſed that ſuch perſons are in a woefull and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable caſe.

Some that <hi>ſtumble in their wayes from the ancient pathes, Iere.</hi> 18. 15. Now to ſtumble at Chriſt, at the word, at the Law, at the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient wayes, at Religion, this is a <hi>woefull</hi> thing. There is but one true Religion in which a man can be ſaued, now therefore <hi>woe</hi> to him that ſtumbles at true Religion, for there is no way but infallible dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for ſuch a man. There is no way of ſaluation but by Chriſt, <hi>There is no other name vnder heauen to be ſaued by, Act.</hi> 4. 12. Therefore <hi>woe</hi> to that man that ſtumbles at Chriſt, for that man puts himſelfe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:259:57"/> out of poſſibilitie of ſaluation. The word, is the <hi>word of grace, Act.</hi> 20. 32. <hi>the word of life, Ioh.</hi> 6. 68. <hi>the word of the kingdome, Mat.</hi> 13. 19. therfore <hi>woe</hi> to that man that ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at the word, for he puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of poſſibilitie of grace, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and the kingdome of God. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting or reſtoring the ſoule, Pſal.</hi> 19. 7. therefore <hi>woe</hi> to him that ſtumbles at the Law, for hee is out of poſſibilitie of being conuerted, and reſtored. <hi>The old and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient wayes are the good wayes wherein a man ſhall finde reſt to his ſoule. Ier.</hi> 6. 16. Therefore <hi>woe</hi> to that man that ſtumbles at and from the antient wayes, becauſe what poſſibility hath hee of finding reſt to his ſoule?</p>
               <p>Now by <hi>ſcandals</hi> and offences <hi>ſtumbling blockes</hi> are laide to make men <hi>ſtumble</hi> at theſe, and ſo to bring <hi>woe</hi> vpon their ſoules. When

               <p>And that ſcandals, doe make men thus ſtumble at Religion, the word, &amp;c. how plaine doth daylie experience make it? let ſuch an one as profeſſes Chriſt, his word, his truth fall into any ſcandal, and what followes? Oh! Say men, this is their religion, this is their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, doe ye not ſee what perſons they are that are of this ſame holy religion, and profeſſion? Are there any worſe then theſe, more diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and deceitfull? If this be their religion, God bleſſe mee from their

And thus through diuine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance puniſhing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitablenes vnder the word, they ſo ſtumble at theſe ſcandals, as to fal into an hatred, and diſlike of ſauing religion, and ſauing powerfull profeſſion of it. Into which who ſo falles, how woefully falles he?</p>
               <p>That ſcandals doe bring this woe vpon the world, and proue ruining ſtumbling blockes thus to make them fall, is further cleere by that, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Yee are departed out of the way.</hi> It is a charge vpon the Prieſts. The <note n="u" place="margin">

Pauli ſer. 1.</note> Prieſts that preached; &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the law, they departed out of the way, they committed groſſe and fowle ſcandals what was the iſſue of it? A great deale of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe followed vpon it, namely, a <hi>woe,</hi> an heauie woe, vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:259:59"/> from their ſcandals. But what was that <hi>woe? Yee haue cauſed many</hi> to ſtumble <hi>at the Law,</hi> that, is to ſtumble at true religion, and the wayes of God. When the people ſaw the Prieſts that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and preacht the Law, and who ſo great Zelots for the Law as they, when they ſaw theſe Prieſts to liue ſo looſely, and ſo ſcandalouſly they began to ſtart at it, and to queſtion happily whether this Law, this religion they preached, and profeſſed were of God or no. And if this were their law, and their religion, for their parts they were reſolued neuer to haue to doe with ſuch a Law, with ſuch a religion. Thus their ſcandals did ſtumble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> And thus did their ſcandals bring an heauie woe vpon the people, for what a woefull condition was this, thus to ſtumble at the Law, at the true religion of God? what was this, but to ſeale vp, and make ſure
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:259:60"/> their owne damnation? for if they would none of the Law, they could none of Heauen, if ſhut out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, what remayned but Hell? The Lord had, it is likely, a long while called vpon the people by his Prophets, they would not hearken nor repent, nor imbrace the truth of God. The Lord therefore in his Iuſtice reſolues to be reuenged vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, by bringing a woe vpon them. And what woe would God bring vpon them! This woe of ſtumbling at religion that ſo hee might make ſure worke with them, that ſince they would not be ſaued, when hee offred them ſaluation, therfore now they ſhould ueuer be ſaued. But now what courſe will God take to effect this, and bring this woe vpon them. Hee will in his wiſe prouidence lay the ſtumbling blocke of the Prieſts ſcandals in their way, at which they ſhall ſo ſtumble as to diſlike the Law, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:259:60"/> to fall into an vtter diſtaſt of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which they ſhould make ſure worke againſt their owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. And ſo woe was vnto the people from the Prieſts ſcandals.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Scandals make way for woe in that they make way to occaſion, men of the world to fall into the fowle and woefull ſinne of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Gods holy Name. It is a <hi>woefull</hi> thing to fall into that ſinne, eſpecially ſo to fall into it, as to make that the ioy of our hearts which tends to the reproach and diſhonour of his Name. The Name of God is <hi>a glorious and a fearefull Name. Deut.</hi> 28. 50. and therefore how <hi>woefull and fearefull</hi> a thing for a man to blaſpheme that Name. What doth he better then cut him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe off, from all communion with God that blaſphemes his Name, that flies in his face, and triumphes in his reproach. It is ſaid of the malicious Iewes. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 45. that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:259:61"/> they ſpake againſt <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine <hi>contradicting, and blaſpheming.</hi> And marke what followes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 46. <hi>Seeing yee put the word of God from you, and iudge your ſelues vnworthy of euerlaſting life, loe we turne to the Gentiles.</hi> See then when they blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed what they did, They <hi>put away the word from them,</hi> they iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themſelues <hi>vnworthy of life,</hi> they cauſed God to <hi>turne away</hi> the meanes of ſaluation from them. Such a caſe is a woefull caſe, and to this caſe will contradicting &amp; blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming of God, and his truth, and Religion bring men. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this regard are ſcandals wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full euents becauſe they occaſion men to blaſpheme and ſpeake euill of God and his truth. When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> fell in to that foule Scandal, what followed vpon it? See 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>By this deede thou haſt giuen great occaſion to the enemies of God to blaſpheme.</hi> Thoſe amongſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:259:61"/> the people that were haters of true godlineſſe, and enemies to the powerfull profeſſion thereof and ſo enemies of God when <hi>Dauid</hi> fell into this ſinne, they fell into a <hi>woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> caſe, they preſently fall a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming of Religion, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euill of godlineſſe, and he that blaſphemes godlineſſe blaſphemes God, and ſo by this meanes cauſes God in wrath peremptorily to turne from them. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 23. 24. <hi>thorough you the name of God is blaſphemed a mongſt the Gentiles.</hi> So that the ſcandalous ſinnes of the Iewes were ſtumbling blockes to the Gentiles that made them fall into that fowle ſin of blaſpheming, that muſt needes make them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of eternall life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Scandals make way for woe, in that they make way for the hardning of the hearts, and ſtiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the neckes of ſinnefull men in their euill wayes. It is a very
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:259:62"/> dangerous thing, for a man to bee in a ſinnefull way, but for a man to haue his hand ſtrengthened in his Iniquity, to bee hardened in any ſinne, this is a woefull condition. It is the greateſt <hi>woe,</hi> and <hi>curſe</hi> that can be to haue ones hart hardened. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 64. 65. <hi>Render vnto them a recompence O Lord according to the worke of their hands, Giue them</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie <hi>of heart, thy</hi> curſe <hi>vnto them. Salomon</hi> ſpeakes of the <hi>plagues in the heart.</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 8. 38. The plague in the body, is a woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſeaſe, and what then is the plague in the heart. God threatens <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with this plague, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>I will at this time ſend all my</hi> plagues <hi>vpon thine heart,</hi> and ſee how God did it. <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>Goe into</hi> Pharaoh <hi>for I haue</hi> hardened <hi>his heart.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Hardnes,</hi> or <hi>Hardening</hi> of the heart is the <hi>plague</hi> of the heart. God ſent ten plagues vpon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> but this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:259:62"/> plague of his heart, in the harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, was ten times greater then all the plagues of Aegypt. It is that which vſually God premiſes, and fore-ſendes when hee meanes to prepare men to temporall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. When God meanes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, to ſpeede a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or a whole nation, and to bring ineuitable deſtruction vpon them, God firſt makes way for it, by the hardening of mens hearts. <hi>Exo.</hi> 14. 17. When God would get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe honour in the deſtruction of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians. I will ſaith hee,</hi> harden their hearts, <hi>and they ſhall follow them, and I will get me honour vpon Pharaoh.</hi> So <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 11. 19. 20. Not a City that made peace, with the children of <hi>Iſrael, ſaue the Hiuites the Inhabitants of Gibeon, They tooke all in battell.</hi> But why did not other Cities, doe as the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> why did not they ſubmit, and ſeeke their peace? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:259:63"/> God had a purpoſe, they ſhould bee deſtroyed, and to make the ſurer way for it, gaue them vp to an hardened heart, <hi>for it was of the Lord, to harden their hearts, that they ſhould come out againſt Iſrael in battell, that he might deſtroy them vtterly, and that they might haue no fauour but that hee might deſtroy them.</hi> So that when God meanes that a man ſhall haue <hi>no fauour,</hi> but be <hi>vtterly deſtroyed</hi> then God firſt giues men vp to <hi>hardneſſe</hi> of heart. Nay, it is that which is a <hi>woefull</hi> preparatiue to eternall wrath, it is that which lockes men, and ſhuts them faſt vp, and keepes them ſure for eternal vengeance. When God is ſo angrie, as that hee is peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily reſolued that a man ſhal not be ſaued, but bee damned without all peraduenture, then God giues him vp to the hardneſſe of heart, vnder which hee ſhall be ſurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued vnto the day of wrath.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:259:63"/>
               <p> When a Prince is reſolued to put a man to death, he commands him firſt to bee ſurely impriſoned, to bee laid faſt in fetters and irons. When <hi>Herod</hi> meant to execute <hi>Peter,</hi> ſee what ſure worke is made, <hi>He is deliuered to foure quaternions of Souldiers to bee kept,</hi> hee lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>two Souldiers, bound with two chaines, and the keepers before the doores keeping the priſon, Act.</hi> 12 4, 6. So that in reaſon there was an impoſſibilitie of his eſcape from death.</p>
               <p>So when God will make ſure worke with a man, and is peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie for his execution, the Lord deliuers him vp to hardneſſe of heart, and this hardneſſe of heart wil be as <hi>quaternions of Souldiers,</hi> as <hi>Chaines,</hi> and <hi>Keepers,</hi> Lockes, Barres, Bolts, and Fetters, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue a man ſure for damnation. A man hath had the meanes of grace offered him, he hath ſlighted them,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:259:64"/> and he wil goe on, and hee wil doe this and that, ſay all the Preachers what they wil, and can to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. When God ſees this, hee thus reſolues. Here is a man that I would haue ſaued, I offered him the outward meanes of grace, but he hath ſtubbornly &amp; rebelliouſly ſtood out againſt the meanes, I am reſolued hee ſhal neuer be ſaued. I but perhaps the man liues ſtil vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the meanes of grace, and ſo long there is a poſſibilitie of his conuerſion, and if he be conuerted he muſt needs be ſaued. Therefore God to keepe him from ſaluation will take a courſe ſure enough to keepe him from conuerſion. Now what courſe is that? God wil haue ſuch a mans heart hardened. And if once the heart be hardened there is no poſſibilitie of Conuerſion, &amp; if no Conuerſion, no Saluation. This proceſſe of Diuine Iuſtice &amp; vengeance we haue. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Make</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:259:64"/> 
                  <hi>the heart of this people fat, and make their eares heauie, and ſhut their eies leſt they ſee with their eyes, and heare with their eares, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand with their heart, and conuert and be healed.</hi> We ſee in the end of the Verſe, that Gods full and finall reſolution is that they ſhall <hi>not bee healed,</hi> that is, they ſhall not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as appeares, <hi>Mark.</hi> 4. 12. But how will God keepe them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaued, they hauing, and hearing the Word? They ſhall <hi>not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted.</hi> But how will he keepe them from Conuerſion? They <hi>ſhall not vnderſtand with their heart,</hi> though they heare. But how will hee keepe them from vnderſtanding with their heart? <hi>Goe make</hi> the heart <hi>of this people fat,</hi> that is, Goe harden their hearts. When the heart is hardened they cannot vnderſtand with the heart, when they cannot vnderſtand with the heart, they cannot bee conuerted, when they
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:259:65"/> cannot be conuerted, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaued. And ſo the hardening of the heart is nothing elſe but the locking, and the ſhutting, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a man vp, to keepe him ſure and faſt for Hell. So that for a man to bee giuen vp to hardneſſe of heart is a ſigne, and a <hi>wofull</hi> ſigne that a man is ſuch an one, as on whoſe ſoule God is reſolued to ſhew no mercie, and that a man is in the wofull ſtate of reprobation. Therefore ſee how the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. <hi>Therefore hee hath mercie on whom hee will haue mercie, and whom he will he hardens.</hi> See how <hi>hardening,</hi> and <hi>ſhewing mercie</hi> ſtand in oppoſition. <hi>Whom he will he hardens,</hi> that is, he repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and ſhewes no mercie to. But why ſayes he not, to whom hee will ſhew no mercie, hee ſhewes none, but in ſteed of that, <hi>whom he will hee hardens?</hi> Becauſe God makes way for the execution of his
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:259:65"/> counſell of Reprobation by Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening mens hearts. By al this then it is cleere, that it is a <hi>wofull</hi> thing to bee giuen vp to the hardneſſe of heart, <hi>woe</hi> to that man that hath his heart hardened.</p>
               <p>Now then Scandals are <hi>wofull</hi> euents vnto men of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be ſuch ſnares and ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks, as make and occaſion them to fall into this <hi>wofull</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hardening their hearts. Therefore <hi>woe to the world becauſe of ſcandals,</hi> becauſe by ſcandals their hearts ſhalbe hardened, they ſhall haue the wofull plague of the heart, they ſhall come vnder a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full curſe, be brought into a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue condition for temporall and eternall ruine. For when men ſee ſuch as make profeſſion of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to fall into ſcandals, and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous euils, it occaſions them excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to harden their hearts, and to bleſſe themſelues in their euill,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:259:66"/> &amp; vngodly wayes, as if their wayes were better then the wayes of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and their perſons in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſtate and condition then theirs that make ſuch adoe with their profeſſion.</p>
               <p>Wee may conceiue the truth of this in the ſcandal of the Inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Corinthian, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. There were multitudes of Heathen Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians that had not yet receiued Chriſt, nor his Goſpel. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Corinthians had queſtionleſſe beene dealing with the Heathen Corinthians, to bring them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for the ſins of their Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliſme. What thoſe ſinnes were wee may ſee, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Neither fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, nor effeminate, &amp;c. nor Thieues, nor Couetous, nor Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, &amp;c. And</hi> ſuch <hi>were ſome of you.</hi> Namely, when they liued in their Heathen condition. Now out of theſe ſinnes would not the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:259:66"/> Heathen reſidue be brought. Now when all meanes, and endeauours for their reclaiming were in vaine, God in his Iuſtice would euen giue them vp to that wofull condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being hardened in thoſe their ſinnes.</p>
               <p>To this end in his prouidence a ſcandalous euent is diſpoſed to come to paſſe in the ſinne of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous Corinthian, which could not but turne to the great harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Heathens heart in their ſinnes, Then began they to ſay and thinke in their hearts, They told vs our eſtates, and our wayes were dangerous and damnable, but to bee ſure, our wayes are as good as theirs. Wee are better yet then theſe profeſſours of Chriſt, we are honeſter at the hardeſt, then are they, The fornication and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that is <hi>acted</hi> and committed amongſt them is not once <hi>named</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:259:67"/>
               <p> Wee will therefore euen keepe vs in theſe wayes, and goe on in theſe courſes ſtill. For if ſuch as theſe profeſſe themſelues to be, if your holy and ſtrict Chriſtians may doe ſuch vile things as theſe, then I trow it is not ſuch an hainous thing for vs that make no ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to bee Drunkards, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Swearers, &amp;c. And thus by occaſion of this ſcandal did they confirme, hearten, and harden themſelues in their iniquities. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any of the Chriſtians had after the falling out of this ſcandal, but offered to haue reproued an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Corinthian for Fornication, Drunkenneſſe, &amp;c. what anſwere was he like to haue had but ſuch an one as this. Oh Sir, it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, you ſhould find fault with me, though now and then I may bee drunke, or commit fornication yet I am not ſuch a beaſt, as ſuch an one your fellow Chriſtian, that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:259:67"/> made ſuch adoe with his holineſſe, that hath now married his fathers Wife, I would you ſhould know it, I am as honeſt as he, and as good a liuer as hee for his heart. And ſo ſhooke they off all admonition and reproofe, &amp; hardened their hearts againſt all remedies by occaſion of that ſcandal. And ſo was there a <hi>woe</hi> to many an Heathen Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian, from the ſcandal of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous Chriſtian, becauſe they ſtumbled at it &amp; were enſnared by it, ſo as to harden the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in their ſinful courſes, &amp; ſo by that hardnes were ſealed vp to aſſured wrath.</p>
               <p>There is nothing hardens men in their Iniquitie more, then to Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie them in their ſinfull wayes. There is a Iuſtification of a ſinner <hi>from</hi> his vngodlineſſe, and there is a Iuſtification of a ſinner <hi>in</hi> his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt is a bleſſed thing, and makes a man happie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 1, 2.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:259:68"/>
               <p> The ſecond is woeful, diſmal, and dangerous. Iuſtification of a ſinner <hi>from</hi> his ſins is called <hi>a Iuſtification of life, Rom.</hi> 5. 18. But Iuſtification of a ſinner <hi>in</hi> his ſinnes is a <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of death,</hi> that ſeales vp a man to damnation. Iuſtification of a ſinner <hi>from</hi> ſinne is an <hi>Act of Gods grace,</hi> and mercie, and ſo he iuſtifies the vngodly, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 4 5. <hi>on him that iuſtifies the vngodly)</hi> by acquitting, diſcharging, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluing him from the guilt of his vngodlineſſe. Iuſtification of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in his ſinne <hi>is an act of Gods wofull vengeance</hi> puniſhing men for former vngodlineſſe, and making way for the infallible aſcertaining of his damnation. And for Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a ſinner in his ſinnes is way made by ſcandalous euents. And that ſcandalous euents doe iuſtifie vngodly men in their ſins, and ſo harden them therein, may appeare by that, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 51. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath Samaria committed halfe</hi>

                  <hi>thy ſinnes, but thou haſt multiplied thine abominations more then they, and haſt iuſtified thy ſiſters in all their abominations which thou haſt done. Samaria</hi> was one of <hi>Iudahs</hi> ſiſters; The <hi>Samaritans</hi> were an idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous wicked people, <hi>Iudah</hi> ſhee profeſſed her ſelfe the people of God. Now <hi>Iudah</hi> that profeſſed her ſelf Gods people, fel into foule, and ſcandalous abominations. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> committed not halfe her ſinnes. Vpon this, <hi>Samaria</hi> begins to Saint her ſelfe, and to iuſtifie her ſelfe, being iuſtified by <hi>Iudah.</hi> Which may be vnderſtood not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>euent,</hi> that <hi>Samaria</hi> was leſſe vniuſt, and vnrighteous in compariſon of <hi>Iudah,</hi> but alſo of the <hi>effect</hi> or <hi>conſequent</hi> of that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, becauſe <hi>Samaria</hi> in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her ſelfe with <hi>Iudah,</hi> finding herſelfe more iuſt, that is leſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, did thereby poſitiuely iuſtifie her ſelfe, as if ſhee were in a good
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:259:69"/> caſe, and a good way, becauſe <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah's</hi> abominations were ſo many and ſo great, and becauſe <hi>Iudah</hi> is blacker then ſhe, therefore ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes to imagine her ſelfe Lilly white. I, ſayes <hi>Samaria,</hi> it is no maruell that <hi>Iudah</hi> is ſo godly, ſo religious, ſo holy a people, and that I am ſo idolatrous, and ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, I am ſure I am not halfe ſo bad as ſhe. For all their godlineſſe, and Religion they talk of, for any thing I ſee, my life, courſes, dealings are as good, and honeſt, nay, more iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable then theirs. And if <hi>Iudah</hi> that profeſſes ſuch ſingular holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, doe thus and thus I hope my wayes being better then hers, my condition is better.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:259:69"/> and by ſuch iuſtifying of her ſelfe, ſhe hardened and ſtrengthened her ſelfe in her ſinnes, and ſo were <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dahs</hi> ſcandals and abominations <hi>woefull</hi> euents to <hi>Samaria,</hi> becauſe thereby her heart was hardened to her deſtruction.</p>
               <p>It is with ſcandals as it was with thoſe falſe Prophets, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 22. <hi>Yee ſtrengthened the hands of the wicked that hee ſhould not returne from his wicked way.</hi> Men cannot bee ſaued if they bee not turned from their euill wayes, men cannot be turned from their euill wayes, if their hands bee ſtrengthened in them, and their hearts hardened. Now here was the miſchiefe and the woe that came by thoſe falſe Prophets, they ſtrengthened mens hands, and hardened their hearts in their euill wayes that they could not be ſaued. Such is the miſchiefe and the woe of ſcandals, men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ſaued, vnleſſe they returne
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:259:70"/> from their wicked way, they cannot returne from their wicked way ſo long as their hands bee ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>and woe to the world becauſe of ſcandals,</hi> for they ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked, and ſo make way for their fatall ruine.</p>
               <p>Scandals are that to the World, that thoſe things were to the <hi>Iewes, Rom.</hi> 11. 9. <hi>Let their table bee made a ſnare, a trap, and a ſtumbling blocke, and a recompence vnto them.</hi> When no meanes of grace will ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hard hearts and bring them to Repentance, God in his Iuſtice diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of ſcandals, and they are made ſnares, traps, and ſtumbling blockes, and a recompence vnto them that God may recompence them for their vnprofitablenes; and by thoſe ſcandals, occaſion them to harden their hearts to their ruine, that would not bee ſoftened vnto life.</p>
               <p>It is otherwiſe to the World
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:259:70"/> from the ſcandals and fals of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, then it was to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> from the fall of the <hi>Iewes</hi> from Chriſt. The fall of the <hi>Iewes</hi> was for the happineſſe of the <hi>Gentiles. Rom.</hi> 11. 11, 12. <hi>Haue they ſtumbled that they ſhould fall?</hi> that is, fall quite and cleane off, <hi>God forbid, But through their fall, ſaluation is come vnto the Gentiles, The fall of them is the riches of the world.</hi> But now in ſcandalous fals of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors into foule ſinnes it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <hi>Thorough their fals damnation comes to many,</hi> and they are the miſchiefe, miſerie and vndoing of many. And that on this manner. God many times vouchſafes the meanes of grace and repentance to a people, in thoſe meanes ſtriues a long time with them, but ſtriues in vaine. Therefore he reſolues thus, My ſpirit ſhal ſtriue no longer with them, but ſince they will not, they ſhall not be ſaued, I will take a ſure
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:259:71"/> courſe for their damnation. I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued they ſhall not be ſaued, and becauſe they ſhallbe ſure neuer to bee ſaued, I will make ſure they ſhall neuer be conuerted, And that they may bee made ſure for euer being conuerted, I will take a courſe that they ſhall not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the word they heare with their hearts, and that they may not vnderſtand the word they heare, I will take a courſe for the hardening of their hearts, &amp; for the thorough hardening of their hearts ſome profeſſour of religion ſhall fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſcandal, and thereby ſhall their hearts bee hardened ſeuen fold more then euer, they ſhall iuſtifie themſelues in their ſinnes, and ſo by an hard heart ſhall put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues out of all poſſibilitie of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, and ſo out of all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of ſaluation. How often would I haue had you riſen, and yee would not riſe? therefore now

               <p>That therefore yee may fall into a miſchiefe, and with a miſchiefe; yee ſhalbe hardened, and that you may fall into greater hardnes of heart, ſome man ſhall fall into ſcandal; his fall into ſcandal ſhall make way for a <hi>woe</hi> to fall vpon your heads. His ſcandal ſhall harden you, that hardnes ſhall make you fall into miſchiefe. And thus woe to the world becauſe of offences, becauſe they come to ſtiffen, and harden their ſpirits, and as meſſengers of wrath to bind them ſure, hand and foote, that they may be prepared, to bee throwne out into vtter darkeneſſe.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>woe to the world, becauſe of offences,</hi> becauſe the world is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by them, to reiect the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing profeſſion of Religion, to fall fowle on Gods holy Name, to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:259:72"/> iuſtifie themſelues in their ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wayes, and ſo by theſe things to make hell ſure their owne. So that the fall of a profeſſour of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is as the fall of an oake vpon vnderwood, and ſmaller trees, that be neere it: woe to them, when the oake falls, becauſe it miſchiefes, bruſhes and breakes them in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by its fall. It is iuſt in this caſe, as it was in the ouerthrow of that Army. <hi>Ier.</hi> 46. 12. <hi>The mighty man hath ſtumbled againſt the mighty, and they are both fallen together,</hi> firſt one fel, he being fallen; another ſtumbles at him, and ſo they both lay on the ground together. Thus falles it out in ſcandals. Firſt one falles into ſome great ſinne, others come and ſtumble at him being fallen, and ſo both fall, and the firſt mans fall is the laſt mans ruine. And therefore <hi>woe to the world becauſe of ſcandals.</hi>

Like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough <hi>Canaan</hi> when he firſt eſpied it, came running to his father, with much ioy in his face, Oh father I can tell you excellent Newes, the braueſt Newes that can be, Newes that will doe you good at the very heart, doe but goe along with mee,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:259:76"/> and I will ſhew you ſuch a ſight as you neuer ſaw. Look where that old Dotard lies drunke, and in what a baſe and ſhamefull faſhion? This is he that alwayes telling me of my ſwearing, cenſuring mee for my want of religion, this is hee that was ſo holy, ſo full of his religion, and godlines, ſee there how like a beaſt he lies.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:259:77"/> merrime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? wil any man that is in his wits reioyce at that euent, whoſe errand purpoſely is to bring Gods curſe vpon him. So little cauſe had <hi>Cham,</hi> and <hi>Canaan</hi> to reioyce at <hi>Noahs</hi> fall. And euery whit, as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cauſe hath the world to reioyce when ſcandals come, for then <hi>woe</hi> comes, God is ſetting his ginnes, and ſnares, &amp; traps to catch ſome, hee ſends forth his meſſengers of wrath, to doe ſeuere Iuſtice vpon perſons that haue beene vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnder the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe God ſhould ſend the ſword amongſt men, would men reioyce and bee glad at it? See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21. 9, 10. <hi>A ſword, A ſword is ſharpened, and alſo fourbiſhed, It is ſharpened to make a ſore ſlaughter, it is fourbiſht that it may glitter, ſhould we then make mirth?</hi> I trow not. And why not make mirth in ſuch a caſe? Becauſe the ſword brought <hi>woe</hi> and <hi>miſchiefe</hi> with it,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:259:78"/> becauſe it came to be diſmall, and fatal, becauſe it was a meſſenger of wrath and vengeance. And why then make men mirth at ſcandals when they come? May we not true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay of this laughter, <hi>Thou art mad,</hi> and of this mirth, <hi>what doth it? Eccl.</hi> 2. 2. Come not <hi>ſcandals</hi> with a <hi>woe</hi> as well as the <hi>ſword?</hi> And is hee not as mad that reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth at the comming of <hi>ſcandals,</hi> as hee is that reioyces at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of a <hi>ſword?</hi> Say, a <hi>ſcandal</hi> a <hi>ſcandal,</hi> it is fowle and heynous, it is come with <hi>woe,</hi> to make a ſore ſpirituall ſlaughter, <hi>ſhould wee then make mirth,</hi> and reioyce at it? God forbid. <hi>Woe vnto the world becauſe of ſcandals,</hi> and ſhall we laugh, and ſport with Gods <hi>woes?</hi> This makes ſcandals doubly <hi>woefull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That ſame is good counſel which <hi>Salomon</hi> giues <hi>Prou.</hi> 24. 17, 18. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce not when thine enemy falles, and let not thine heart bee glad when</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:259:78"/> 
                  <hi>he ſtumbles.</hi> If a man haue an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that hates him, if any croſſe or calamity befalls him a man may not reioyce at it, nor bee glad of it not onely when he <hi>falles,</hi> and God vtterly ruines him, but if he doe but <hi>ſtumble,</hi> and God lay but ſome ſmaller croſſe vpon him. Now marke the reaſon, <hi>leaſt the Lord ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and he turne away his wrath from him,</hi> and ſo turne it vpon thee. So that the ſumme of the reaſon is, leaſt God ſhould bee angry, and his wrath ſhould be againſt thee. Marke then; If I may not reioyce at a mans <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtumbling and fall,</hi> then how much leſſe may I reioyce in a <hi>mans ſpirituall ſtumbling and falling,</hi> how much more will that diſpleaſe and anger God? If I may not reioyce at his outward fall leaſt God <hi>ſhould</hi> be angrie, then much leſſe when in another mans ſpirituall ſtumbling and fall God <hi>is</hi> angrie with mee,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:259:79"/> and out of his anger againſt mee diſpoſes his fall. Little cauſe haue I to reioyce at anothers ſtumbling and falling, when God in wrath diſpoſes of another mans ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to make mee ſtumble, and of another mans fall to make me fall. What cauſe haue I to reioyce at his ſtumbling and falling, who ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtumbles and fals that I may ſtumble and fall at him. And this is the very caſe here. Such as doe giue ſcandals <hi>doe ſtumble</hi> that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>may ſtumble</hi> at them, <hi>doe</hi> fall that others <hi>may</hi> fall at them, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 46. 12. <hi>The mightie man hath ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled againſt the mightie: and they are both fallen together.</hi> It is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Egyptians ruined in war. It may bee that one Captaine that hated his fellow might ſee him fall by the ſword of the enemie. Now though he were his enemie that he ſee fal, had he any cauſe to reioyce? Not any at all. Why ſo? Becauſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:259:79"/> God prouidence diſpoſed that the fall of the firſt ſhould make way for the fall and ruine of the next. He that fell firſt ſhould lie in his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes way as a ſtumbling blocke at which hee ſhould ſtumble and fall alſo. Thus we ſaw before that the fals of ſuch as profeſſe Religion, are but as ſtumbling blockes in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens wayes to precipitate them into ruine. And iudge then what cauſe they haue to reioyce thereat. If a man ſhould ſee a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſtone, or a ſtumbling blocke laid on purpoſe at a pits brinke to topple him headlong ouer into the pit, would that man reioyce that that blocke were laid there? I think not. This is the caſe here. Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals are <hi>ſtumbling blockes</hi> laide at hell pits mouth to precipitate, and head-long worldly wicked men downe into hel. So that to reioyce at ſcandals is to reioyce at the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and inſtrument of their owne
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:259:80"/> ſorrow to reioyce at that which will ſurely ſend them to Hell. Hee that reioyces in ſuch a caſe, Much good may his ioy doe him, I enuie no man ſuch ioy.</p>
               <p>There fell out a ſcandal in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5. Now whereas vpon the euent of it they ſhould haue beene mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and heauie, they were in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other veine, <hi>Verſe</hi> 2, 6. They were <hi>glorying,</hi> and <hi>reioycing.</hi> They did not reioyce <hi>in,</hi> or <hi>at</hi> the ſcandal, that ſuch a man that made ſuch a profeſſion was fallen, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced in their owne gifts, in the gifts of their Preachers. What Church had ſuch Preachers, what people had ſuch gifts? And reioyce they might in theſe things, but now it was vnſeaſonable, they ſhould now rather haue beene mourning, becauſe of this ſcandal. Therefore the Apoſtle ſharply takes them vp, <hi>Verſe.</hi> 2, 6. <hi>And ye are puffed vp, and</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:259:80"/> 
                  <hi>haue not rather mourned, your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, or reioycing is not good.</hi> If then the Apoſtle reprooues them thus for reioycing when there was a ſcandal, though they reioiced not at the ſcandal, how much more vehemently, and ſharply would he haue reprooued them if they had reioyced at, and for the ſcandal? How much more in this caſe would he haue ſaid, <hi>your reioycing is not good. Woe</hi> to the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſcandals, and yet many make theſe matters of <hi>woe</hi> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters, but <hi>woe</hi> vnto them that in ſuch a caſe laugh, for they ſhall weepe, and after-time, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-wit will teach them, that neuer had they greater cauſe of weeping, then euen then when they were vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their merry pinnes, becauſe that at which they made themſelues ſo merrie, came with a woe vnto them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, this lets vs ſee
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:259:81"/> what great cauſe of feare, warines, and caution there is in caſe of ſcandalous euents. Since they be ſuch dangerous euents, let men haue a ſpeciall care they be not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared, and entrapped by them. When ſcandals fall out, wee ſee there is a trap, and a ſnare ſet, there is a ſtumbling block laid, therefore it ſhould bee a mans wiſdome, and watchfulnes that he be not caught in the trap, that he be not enſnared in the gin, that he ſtumble and fall not at the block. We ſee that God hath put that wiſdome, warineſſe, and ſhineſſe into ſome creatures, that if a trap, or a ſnare bee ſet for them, they are very ſhie, &amp; iealous of comming neere it, or medling with the baite, and out of a feare of being taken, they will decline and ſhunne the ſnare, though tempted and allured thereto by ſuch baites as otherwiſe they haue a full good mind vnto. Such, much more
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:259:81"/> ſhould bee the ſhineſſe, and wary iealouſie of men in the caſe of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous euents. Doe wee ſee at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time ſuch as profeſſe religion to fall into any fowle euils, then thinke thus with thy ſelfe. I had thought that when ſuch euents had come to paſſe, the danger of them had beene onely a perſonall danger to the partie Delinquent, that it had beene onely for the diſcouerie, and for the diſgrace of him, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dreamt of any further matter, and therefore I thought I might haue made a may-game of them, and haue reioyced and triumphed in their fals. But now I ſee there is a further matter in them then I was aware of, I ſee that they come to paſſe by Diuine Prouidence, to bring a <hi>woe</hi> vpon other mens heads. I ſee they come, that ſome may bee occaſioned to ſtumble at Religion, at the Law, at the Word, and from the ancient pathes, that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:259:82"/> hereupon they ſhould reſoluedly reiect &amp; renounce ſauing Religion, and the ſauing powerful profeſſion thereof to their owne aſſured ruine for euer. I ſee now that they bee diſpoſed by a Diuine Prouidence, that ſome men being occaſioned to blaſpheme Gods Name, &amp; Truth, may feele the weight of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging hand. I now ſee there is a Diuine finger in them, and that they come to occaſion ſome men to harden their hearts ſo, as they may fall into miſchiefe; and be put out of poſſibilitie, and the reach of mercie. Theſe bee great dangers and heauie <hi>woes,</hi> for I ſee now they be but ſtumbling blockes, at which ſome men ſhall breake their neckes into Hell. I confeſſe, I did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer conceiue them to bee halfe ſo dangerous euents, I neuer appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended them ſuch dangerous traps and ſnares, as now vpon the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this point I ſee they are.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:259:82"/> Belieue it, I ſee it is good wiſdome in ſuch euents to looke about mee, and to take heed how I come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reach of theſe ſnares.</p>
               <p>Since Diuine Prouidence ſets them to make way for Diuine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, though ſuch a man profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Religion, haue committed a foule ſcandal, <note n="c" place="margin">

               <p>Becauſe ſcandalous euents are dangerous euents, this ſhould bee therefore our wiſdome, warineſſe, and caution when they happen.

               <p>God will aſſuredly be meet with ſuch perſons as breake out, and fall into foule notorious ſcandalous Actions, and will meete with them ſharply, and ſeuerely. Woe vnto him by whom the offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. God threatens <hi>Eli</hi> very ſharply, <hi>I haue told him that I will iudge his houſe for euer,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18. But why would God deale ſo ſeuerely? <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſay ſome Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations) <hi>his ſonnes runne into a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, and he reſtrained them not,</hi> or <hi>frowned not vpon them.</hi> If God would puniſh <hi>Eli</hi> for not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scandals, how much more will he puniſh them that giue ſcandals. The practices of <hi>Elies</hi> ſonnes were monſtrous ſcandalous, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 22. and what did they by ſo doing? <hi>Becauſe his ſonnes bringing a</hi> curſe

               <p>The woe that purſues ſuch is threefold. Firſt, <hi>Temporall.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Spirituall.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>An eternall woe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. God will purſue ſuch with <hi>temporall woes.</hi> And they are theſe three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With a <hi>woe</hi> vpon them in their <hi>Name.</hi> A good Name is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding pretious.

For the ſweetnes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and contentment of it before <hi>ſweet oyntment, Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 2. So that for a man to looſe his good Name, is as great a loſſe as to looſe a great eſtate of great riches. It would be iudged a <hi>woefull</hi> condition for a man that had a great eſtate, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of wealth, if Gods hand
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:259:87"/> ſhould follow him, and conſume him, and bring him to nothing. It is no leſſe a wo to be bereft of ones good Name, and to haue the ſmell of that ointment taken away. Now in this thing is there a woe to him by whom an offence and a ſcandal commeth. Not onely the ſweetnes of this ointment is taken away, but that ſweetneſſe is turned into a loathſome and a noyſome ſauour, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>Dead flyes cauſe the ointment of the Apothecarie to ſend forth a ſtinking ſauour, ſo doth a little folly him that is in reputation, for wiſdome and honour.</hi> Let a man haue the honourable name of a wiſeman, yea, of a godly, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, zealous man, which giue the greateſt honour in the world to a man, yet, if he bee guiltie but of a <hi>little folly,</hi> that little folly impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches his Name, as much as a <hi>dead flie</hi> wil doe a boxe of ointment. Let ointment be euer ſo ſweet &amp; good,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:259:88"/> yet if but a <hi>dead flie,</hi> or two be in it, they doe not onely take away the <hi>ſweetneſſe of the ointment,</hi> but cauſe it to ſtinke, and to haue a vile ſauour, ſo that a man will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not ſmell to it, but ſtops his noſe at it.</p>
               <p>Now if a <hi>dead flie</hi> will doe ſo much in a boxe of ointment, what will a <hi>dead dogge,</hi> or ſome ſuch fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy carrion doe? If a <hi>little folly</hi> will ſtaine a mans reputation what will a <hi>great</hi> deale doe?

That ſame ſpeech of <hi>Thamars</hi> (but that Luſt hath no eares) had a great deale of weight in it, when <hi>Amnon</hi> was bent vpon the commiſſion of a foule ſcandalous fact, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 13. <hi>And as for thee thou ſhalt be as one of</hi>

                  <hi>the Fooles in Iſrael.</hi> Indeed that had beene enough to haue ſtayed him, if his Luſt would haue giuen him the libertie of deliberation. It was as if ſhe had ſaid. If thou doeſt this thing, <hi>woe</hi> bee vnto thee. But what <hi>woe?</hi> Now thou art a man of ſome credite and eſteeme, but if thou do this ſcandalous Act, God wil blaſt thy name and credit, <hi>Thou ſhalt be as one of the Fooles of Iſrael.</hi> This is the iuſt hand of God vpon ſuch, that they ſhalbe ſmitten with the loſſe of their credit and Name, and bee counted of the number of the Fooles in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> It is a vile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to be a Foole any where, but to be a <hi>Foole in Iſrael,</hi> to be of vile, and baſe report, and repute in the Church of God, this is an heauie puniſhment. <hi>Amnon</hi> was afterward ſtabd by <hi>Abſoloms</hi> Seruants, had <hi>Amnon</hi> had but any ſenſe left after that ſinne of his, the Sword of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoloms</hi> Seruants could not bee ſo

Ah vile man, ah wretched fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; Why, theſe things were farre more keene and cutting, then the very Swords that murthered him.</p>
               <p>Wee may ſee the truth of this, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 8, 9.

                  <hi>the people.</hi> God brought a <hi>woe</hi> vpon them in their credit and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme, that they were vile in the eſteeme of all, one and another, good and bad. And herein the Lord ſerues men but iuſtly, and payes them with their owne coine. By ſcandals Gods Name is defiled, Gods Name diſgraced, &amp; blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, therefore for their Scandals God ſmites them in their Names, that in the <hi>woe</hi> lighting vpon their Names, they may ſee what it was to diſhonour, &amp; pollute the Name of God; God will pollute their Names that pollute his, and will cauſe that pearle of theirs to bee trod in the dirt, and mire. Yea, God ſo takes to heart the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Name by ſcandals, that though there may bee true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yet ſtill ſome ſtaine may lie vpon the Name. <hi>Dauid</hi> made his peace with God, and truly repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo as the Prophet tels him his

Dauid</hi> did other things that were ſinfull, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of the people, the giuing of <hi>Mephiboſheths</hi> Lands to <hi>Ziba,</hi> why then ſayes the text, <hi>ſaue in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Vriah?</hi> Becauſe though the other were <hi>ſinnes,</hi> yet they were not <hi>ſcandalous ſinnes.</hi> The other was a ſcandalous ſinne, and a ſcandalous ſin is of that heynous nature, that though the guilt be taken away, yet after the wound hath done blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and is cloſed vp, and healed, there will remaine ſome skarre in the Name, and credit. So that of foule ſcandalous offenders it may be ſaid as of the Adulterer, <hi>Prou.</hi> 6. 33. <hi>A wound, and diſhonour ſhall he get, and his reproach ſhall not be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:259:90"/> 
                  <hi>away.</hi> So long as hee liues his reproach will liue with him, yea and out-liue him too, his reproach will laſt as long as his memoriall. And as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> is ſeldome named in Scripture without diſhonour, <hi>Ieroboam that made Iſrael to ſinne,</hi> ſo ſuch feldome be mentioned, but with the remembrance of thir ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, oh that was he that made ſuch a profeſſion of Religion, and yet playde that heynous pranke. Wee haue a caſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 9, 10. that when a man refuſed to doe a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers office, his brothers wife muſt <hi>looſe his ſhooe from off his foot, and ſpit in his face, And his name ſhall be called in Iſrael the houſe of him that hath his ſhooe looſed.</hi> Now all this was great diſgrace, and matter of great reproach, But what was this to the reproach that comes by a ſcandal? How much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach is it to haue all men readie to ſpit in ones face, to haue it ſaid,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:259:91"/> 
                  <hi>the houſe of him</hi> that had his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>looſed,</hi> the man who deſerued to haue <hi>his face ſpit in,</hi> becauſe he occaſioned ſo many to ſpit on, and ſpit at religion and the Goſpell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A <hi>ſecond temporall woe</hi> which God will bring vpon them, and followes vpon the former is <hi>eiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>caſting</hi> of them out of the <hi>ſociety</hi> &amp; <hi>communion</hi> of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

They ſhalbe as <hi>dead men</hi> out of minde, nay worſe, for dead men may bee mentioned with honour and regard, but they ſhalbe as dead men in regard of <hi>ſociety,</hi> their ſociety no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired then the ſociety of a dead man, which euery man abhorres. They are like a <hi>broken veſſell.</hi> A veſſell whileſt it is whole is vſefull, and deſireable, and whileſt whole, vſe is continually made of it, it is called for, enquired for, and is at euery turne in requeſt. But now let ſuch a veſſell bee broken, it is thrown by, throwne out of doores, caſt on the dunghill, none once meddles with it, nor lookes after it.

It was ſcandalous to haue done ſo vnclean an act in any place, but to doe it in a ſacred place with women com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither vpon deuotion, this was egregiouſly ſcandalous. God therefore takes them to doe, and does execution vpon them, and cuts them both off in one day by the Sword of the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> God
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:259:97"/> brought the <hi>wo</hi> of the Sword vpon them. Nay, when they ranne into Scandal becauſe <hi>Eli</hi> did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine them, ſee what God threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens vpon his Poſteritie, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 36. that hee would plague them with ſuch baſe beggerie and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that they <hi>ſhould beg their bread.</hi> If God thus puniſh him for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining, how much more would he haue puniſhed him for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of a Scandal? If it goe thus hard with <hi>Eli</hi> that reſtraines not, how hard will it goe with <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas</hi> that commit the ſcandal?</p>
               <p>Wee cannot haue a more preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and full example in this kinde, then <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe.

And yet for all this wee ſhall ſee how terribly this <hi>woe</hi> purſued him
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:259:98"/> in temporall croſſes in this kinde. Firſt, God ſmites his childe with death, then followes his daughter <hi>Thamars</hi> defilement by her brother <hi>Amnon,</hi> then <hi>Amnons</hi> murder, then the treaſon of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> in which the hand of God was exceeding ſmart, God turnes him out of houſe and home. Whoſe heart would not earne, and bleede to ſee his dolefull departure from Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 30. <hi>And Dauid went vp by the aſcent of mount Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet, and wept as he went vp, and had his head couered, and hee went bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote, and al the people that was with him couered euery man his head and they went vp weeping, as they went vp.</hi> Who could haue beheld ſo ſad and ſo woefull a ſpectacle with drie eyes? But this was not all, his life is endangered, his Concubines de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed in open viewe on the houſe top. And what thinke wee was the ground of all this? For the childs
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:259:98"/> death we ſee, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13, 14. <hi>The Lord hath put away thy ſinne, thou ſhalt not die, howbeit becauſe by this thy deede thou haſt giuen great occaſion to the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme, the child alſo that is borne vnto thee ſhall ſurely die.</hi> It is verie much that faſting and praying can doe, it can caſt out deuils, <hi>This kind goes not out but by faſting and praying, Mark.</hi> 9. 29. And yet faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and praying could not keepe off this <hi>woe</hi> that <hi>Dauids</hi> ſcandal brings vpon him in the childes death, <hi>woe</hi> vnto <hi>Dauid by whom</hi> that <hi>offence came,</hi> therefore ſhall his childe die. And for all the reſt of al thoſe woeful ſorrowes 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 9. 10. 11. 12. we ſee the cauſe of them all, theſe woes were vpon <hi>Dauid</hi> for his ſcandal. And if Gods woe in theſe temporall, &amp; outward calamities will thus purſue and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting, &amp; an humbled ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous offender, how much more
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:259:99"/> will that hand of God purſue that man, vpon whoſe ſcandal followes no Repentance and Humiliation. If <hi>Dauid</hi> the man after Gods owne heart muſt not eſcape, what then ſhall others looke for? If a beloued <hi>Dauid</hi> ſhall haue his teeth on edge with his owne ſowre grapes of his ſcandalous courſes, who then ſhall thinke to goe ſcotfree that is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſcandalous tranſgreſſions? what a ſure &amp; irreſiſtible <hi>wo</hi> is that which Repentance it ſelfe cannot keepe off from a mans children, his life, perſon and goods? And thus <hi>temporall woe</hi> is to him <hi>by whom offences come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. God will purſue, and pinch ſuch as giue offence with <hi>ſpirituall woe.</hi> God will fill ſuch mens hearts, ſpecially if they belong to him, with much ſpirituall woe, and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſoule.

It is true that there is an happineſſe in this woe, and it is ſingular mercy that men are not ſeared, and hardened in their ſinne, but yet for all that there is a great deale of ſmart, &amp; ſorrow, and a great deale of woeful bitternes in the worke of Repentance after a ſcandalous fall, And before ſuch ſhall recouer their peace with God, he will giue them many a <hi>woefull</hi> gripe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and many a bitter potion to drinke. Wee haue an example of it in the Inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian.</hi> He indeede recouered his peace, and his pardon, but yet how woefull was his caſe before it was done. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Leaſt ſuch an one ſhould bee ſwallowed vp of ouer much ſorrow.</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:259:100"/> See then in what a woefull plight he was euen in a ſea and gulfe of ſorrow, ready to bee abſorpt, and ſwallowed vp therein. The Lord therefore plu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged him into the deeps of bitter ſorrow of ſpirit, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him ſo deep as that he was ready to deſpaire, and to bee wholly caſt away. Thus God would make his ſoule ſmart, and his heart ake for this ſcandal of his, would make him feele the truth of Chriſts ſaying, <hi>woe vnto him by whom the offence comes.</hi> It was <hi>Dauids</hi> caſe before him. When hee had fallen into ſcandal, in the matter of <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> and <hi>Vriah,</hi> before hee comes to a redintegration of his former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, God brings him vpon the racke. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51. 12. <hi>Reſtore vnto me the ioy of thy ſaluation,</hi> therefore that was taken away &amp; gone, that ſweet ſunſhine was ouerclouded, yea that ſunne was dreadfully eclipſed, and how fearefull ſuch eclipſes be, they
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:259:100"/> knowe that ſee them. It is no leſſe <hi>woe</hi> for the preſent to looſe the Ioy of ones ſaluation, then to looſe ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation it ſelfe. But that was not all. See <hi>Verſe</hi> 8. <hi>make mee to heare ioy, and gladneſſe that the</hi> bones <hi>which thou haſt</hi> broken may reioyce. God therefore not onely tooke away his ioy, but God brake the <hi>bones</hi> of him. What an exquiſite torture is the puniſhment of the wheele, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Malefactour hath his bones bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken one to day, another to morrow? Such is the <hi>woe</hi> that God wil bring vpon ſcandalous ones, ſpecially if they belong to him, Hee wil bring them to the wheele, he wil cracke and <hi>breake</hi> their <hi>bones,</hi> he will haue them to the racke, and fill their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences with ſo much anguiſh, that they ſhall vndergoe as much woe as if all the bones in their bodies were broken in pieces, <hi>That the bones which thou haſt broken.</hi> Yea their bones ſhalbe ſo broken, that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:259:101"/> they will not quickly, nor ſuddenly bee healed againe. <hi>Nathan</hi> in the Name of God did that which one would haue thought might haue ſet <hi>Dauids</hi> bones and giuen them eaſe, <hi>Thy ſinne is forgiuen thee,</hi> and yet we ſee after this he cries out of his bones, It lay in his bones ſtill.</p>
               <p>When men after Scandals are ouer-quickly whole againe, cranke, and iolly, it is to bee feared, their bones were neuer broken to the purpoſe. Well thus we ſee what a <hi>woe</hi> there is for giuers of offence, <hi>woe</hi> bee to the man whoſe bones God wil breake, and therefore <hi>woe to him by whom the offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth.</hi> If he belong to God, God will breake his bones, if he belong not to God, but were an Hypocrite God, will then happily harden his heart that he may breake his necke.</p>

                  </gap> Now God will not put it vp at mens hands that occaſion others to pollute his Name. God is verie tender of the glorie of his Name.

               <p>That paſſage is worthy our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 20, 23. <hi>When they entred vnto the Heathen whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they went, they prophaned mine holy Name: And I will</hi> ſanctifie <hi>my great Name which was prophaned amongſt the Heathen, which they haue profaned in the middeſt of them, and the Heathen ſhall know that I am the Lord, ſaith the Lord God, when I ſhall bee</hi> ſanctified <hi>in you before their eyes.</hi> See then that God will ſanctifie his Name when men pollute it, and hee will one way or other take order to waſh off that pollution, wherewith men haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed it.

               <p>Now Gods Name is ſometimes

Now luſts when they are made much of, when they be made deere, <hi>hands,</hi> and <hi>eyes,</hi> and <hi>right eyes,</hi> aſſuredly they will <hi>cauſe men to offend.</hi> Therefore the way to ſaue our ſelues that they cauſe not vs to offend, is to offend them, the way is by mortification to <hi>cut off,</hi> and <hi>caſt away,</hi> ſuch hands, feete, and eyes as will cauſe vs to offend. Were but this done how happily might many fowle ſcandals be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented? <hi>If Dauid</hi> had preſently <hi>plucke out</hi> his wanton eye, and caſt

               <p>It may be many a man out of the great pride of his heart, and his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant ſelfe-loue makes his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and eſteeme amongſt men to be his <hi>right hand, his right eye,</hi> his very Idoll. Now this is a luſt that will cauſe a man to offend. A man in this pride and ſelfe-loue to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and vphold his good opinion and eſteeme, runnes into this and that ſecret euill practiſe, and rather then his eſteeme, and credit ſhould ſinke in the world, vſes a number of ſhifts, and diſhoneſt courſes, and a companie of deceitful guiles to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould his eſteeme, and runnes ſo far in at laſt, that he comes not off, with fowle ſcandal. Now mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſelfe denial had preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it. If ſuch a man had pluckt out this eie, cut off this hand and foote, hee had not halted, nor ſtumbled

One chop had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and preuented all, for if he had but denied himſelfe, and thus thought with himſelfe, If it bee Gods will that I ſhall bee low, and meane in the world, if hee will haue mee come downe and be in an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour eſtate, his will bee done, I will humbly ſubmit to his pleaſure, and I will not to vphold my credit in the world for a time, hazard and wound the credit of the Goſpell, and religion, I will tread my credit vnder foote, rather then bring any diſcredit vpon the Goſpell; If thus by ſelfe-deniall a man could haue ſubmitted to Gods wiſedome and adminiſtration, &amp; could haue mortified his ſelfe-loue, ſo as to haue laid his credit and reſpect in the world at Gods foote, how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily might a fowle ſcandal haue beene preuented? Euery vnmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:259:132"/> luſt is a ſcandal that will cauſe a man to offend, ſo many luſts ſo many tares. Therefore burne, and fire thoſe tares, <hi>gather out</hi> and <hi>caſt out</hi> thoſe ſcandals that will breed ſcandals and cauſe offences. <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 40. 41.</p>

                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:259:138"/> grounds of mourning in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>As firſt in regard of the <hi>woe</hi> that is to the world from offences, and the great miſchiefe that will bee done by them, That ſo many will ſtart at and flie from Religion, that ſo many will blaſpheme the Name of God, that ſo many will bee har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened to their owne ruine, here is cauſe enough of mourning to all good hearts. There is a compaſſion and there be bowels to bee ſhowne to mankinde, euen to reprobate ones, and a ſorrow ſhould there be for the loſſe of their bloud. And ſecondly, a ſorrow ſhould there be for Gods diſhonour, the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches reproach. But thirdly, there is yet another ground of ſorrow ariſing from this point, a ſorrow there ſhould bee in ſuch euents in regard of the <hi>woe</hi> that wil fall vpon ſuch by whom the offence comes. If their caſe bee ſuch that ſo many
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:259:138"/> woes will purſue them, then how ſhould mens bowels earne with compaſſion towards them, and out of Chriſtian pitie commiſerate their condition?</p>
               <p>The courſe of the World is to reioyce, and inſult ouer ſuch. That is not lawfull in ſinleſſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>Prou.</hi> 24. 17. <hi>Reioyce not when thine enemy fals,</hi> namely, into ſome outward affliction, <hi>neither let thine heart bee glad when hee ſtumbles;</hi> Therefore much more vnlawfull in caſes of ſin, and ſcandal. This high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſes God. Others it may be reioyce not, are not glad, but in the meane time they mourne not, neither are they in ſorrow for Gods diſhonour, or the offenders danger. Surely, as there is ioy in Heauen when one ſinner repents, and riſes, ſo ſhould there be ſorrow on earth, when one man profeſſing Chriſt, ſinnes, and fals fowle. This was the <hi>Corinthians</hi> fault, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:259:139"/> 2. <hi>And you are puffed vp and haue not rather mourned.</hi> They ſhould therefore in that caſe haue mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſorrowed as for Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, ſo for the danger into which that man by his ſcandal had brought himſelfe. And this being done might be a great helpe to ſtir vp a man falne into a ſcandalous ſin to mourne for himſelfe. For when hee ſhall ſee others lay his caſe to heart, and to be ſo ſenſible of his ill condition, how may it ſtirre vp himſelfe to take his condition to heart much more. It is ſaid that <hi>Samuel</hi> mourned for <hi>Saul,</hi> now when <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould heare that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> mourned for him, if there had been any grace in his heart it could not but haue made him mourne for himſelfe. It muſt needs haue thus wrought vpon him. Doth <hi>Samuel</hi> mourne for mee, and lies my caſe heauie at his heart? Alas then what cauſe haue I to mourne for my
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:259:139"/> ſelfe. It is I that haue ſinned, and it is I that muſt ſmart. What is it to <hi>Samuel,</hi> that I muſt vndergoe ſuch woe, if therefore hee, how much more ſhould I mourne. Thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſorow might prouoke ſuch to mourne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, this ſeueritie of Gods Iuſtice conſidered, it ſerues for the terrour, and the humbling of ſuch by whom offences come.</p>
               <p>Here is that which may breake the hearts of them, and make them melt into godly ſorrow. <hi>Woe vnto him by whom an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence comes.</hi> Is an offence come by thee, and art thou falne into a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal? behold here a woe out of Chriſts mouth purſuing thee, and readie to arreſt thee.

A woe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing thee to caſt thee out of the hearts, and ſocietie of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:259:140"/> A woe following thee to ſmite thee with pouertie and ſickneſſe, A woe to ſmite thy Family, thy Children.

If a man had no care of his owne ſoule, or no care of his credit, or no care of ſocietie with the faithfull, yet if a man had but any bowels of nature towards his poore children, here is that which may make his bowels earne and roule within him. Alas what haue I done? I haue brought a woe vpon my ſelfe, and children. Ah, ſayes <hi>Dauid, Theſe ſheepe what haue they done?</hi> So mayeſt thou, Alas, theſe poore babes, and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Lambes what haue they done?
